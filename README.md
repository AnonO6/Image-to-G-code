# This is part of my PAR course Project for 5th Semister @LNMIIT Jaipur.
The idea for this project emerged from the knowledge learned in PAR course and Digital Image Processing knowledge learned in DIP Course in 4th Sem.
The primary purpose of the application is to convert images into G-code files that can be used to create intricate drawings on various surfaces using a CNC machine as a plotter.
